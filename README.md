GO SPDX Parser Library
======================

Parser library for SPDX written in Go (golang). It includes a CLI tool that has
features such as convert, validate and format (pretty-print).

The CLI tool is a good example on how to use the /spdx, /tag and /rdf packages
in other Go programs. All the features available in the CLI tool are available
in the library as well.

Features (planned for first release)
------------------------------------

The following are currently done:
- SPDX 1.2 (the only version supported at the moment)
- parsing RDF formats using [goraptor][goraptor].
- Convert to/from rdf and tag formats
- Validate SPDX documents
- HTML validation output (use the -html flag)
- Auto-detect the input format (file extension or first line guessing)
- Format (pretty-print) SPDX documents (tag format)


Downloading and installing
--------------------------

The easiest way is by using `go get`:

    go get github.com/spdx/tools-go

This downloads and installs the spdx-go tool and library.
